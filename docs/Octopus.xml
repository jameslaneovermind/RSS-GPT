<title>ECS deployment targets - Assumed role values reset on versions of Octopus Server after 2024.1.5250</title>
<link>https://status.octopus.com/incidents/gs56jr69ghxp</link>
<guid>https://status.octopus.com/incidents/gs56jr69ghxp</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Feb <var> 9</var>, <var>03:23</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - A new release of the ECS target includes a migration that resets the 'Assume IAM Role' to 'Don't assume role'. Targets set to 'Assume role' that depend on this for their deployment process will fail.<br />This impacts customers running Octopus Server 2024.1.5250 and later, using ECS targets and assumed roles.<br />To fix this, these targets can be manually updated to 'Assume role'.<br /><br />We're very sorry for the inconvenience. If you have any issues, please reach out to support@octopus.com.</p>

The issue occurs when a deployment's task log is viewed while the deployment is running. If users navigate away from viewing a running deployment, all task log lines should be successfully saved. This will also avoid the issue where deployment steps may show the wrong status.<br /><br />We are working with our upstream provider to resolve this issue.</p><p><small>Dec <var> 6</var>, <var>06:20</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We have identified an issue where some Octopus Cloud instances since 20 November 2023 are missing some log lines from their task logs.<br /><br />Deployment steps that encounter this problem could also show the wrong status (e.g. showing as still running) even though the step has completed successfully. The deployment task will have the correct status.<br /><br />We are investigating this issue as a priority.</p>

<p><small>Sep <var>22</var>, <var>05:16</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - We have published a fix https://octopus.com/downloads/2023.3.13026<br /><br />A public incident report will be shared with affected customers. If you would like a copy, please get in touch with us at support@octopus.com.</p><p><small>Sep <var>22</var>, <var>00:49</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - We've identified a very likely root cause. We made some changes to our task queues that should have been behind a feature flag, but a change to remove a write lock on the task queue table was accidentally left un-flagged. This means that multiple nodes could pick up the same task accidentally. <br />This confirms that the incident will only affect self-hosted customers using High-Availability mode. <br />We're working on a fix now and should have it available later on today. <br />There are two potential workarounds, although we know that they are not good ones.  Moving to a single node instead of HA will be safe as it removes task queue contention. <br />You could also drain all of the nodes, then turn one of them on at a time. Allow each node to pick up some tasks, then drain it, and turn on the next. This approach would be extremely manual and we don't recommend it.</p><p><small>Sep <var>21</var>, <var>21:39</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We continue to investigate isolated reports from a limited number of self-hosted customers on Octopus Server 2023.3 of this bug: https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/8356. Out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily removed the 2023.3 release from our downloads page while we continue to investigate.</p><p><small>Sep <var>21</var>, <var>04:28</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are currently investigating reports from a limited number of self-hosted customers on Octopus Server 2023.3 of this bug: https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/8356. We will update that bug as our investigation progresses.</p>
