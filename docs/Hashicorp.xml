<title>Bug when creating HVD cluster and HVN simultaneously in Portal UI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Jan <var>31</var>, <var>21:24</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Our Engineering team has resolved the bug. Simultaneous cluster and HVN creation via the UI should now be operating normally. If you continue to experience any problems, please open a ticket with our support team.</p><p><small>Jan <var>31</var>, <var>20:22</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - Our Engineering team has identified the cause for the following incident: <br /><br />There is a bug in production causing some newly-created clusters to be deployed to the wrong HVN when also creating a new network in the same cluster create flow. This is not 100% deterministic as it only happens based on the number of fields changed when configuring the newly created network.<br /><br />A small percentage of newly-created clusters from the UI may not be configured with the intended network. Please double check if your cluster is in the intended network if you created a cluster and HVN simultaneously on the cluster creation form via the UI between December 18, 2023 and now.<br /><br />We are actively working on a fix. Once we have additional information, we will share another update.</p>
