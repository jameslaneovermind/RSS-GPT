<div> [High] - Major Outage: Datadog API Key Validation Unavailable
Summary: From 12:45-1:15 PM US EST, Datadog experienced a major outage affecting the endpoint to validate API keys. This resulted in unavailability of key validation for Datadog Agents, potentially marking some Kubernetes Agents as unhealthy and causing failure to start for newly launched Agents. Additionally, build jobs using the CI Visibility product may have been missing custom tags and measures. <div>
<p><small>Mar <var> 6</var>, <var>12:00</var> EST</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - From 12:45-1:15 PM US EST Datadogâ€™s endpoint to validate Datadog API keys was unavailable. During this window Datadog Agents would be unable to validate their API key. In all cases Agents would continue to send data. Some Agents running in Kubernetes may be marked unhealthy until restarted. Newly started Agents would fail to start. Build jobs using our CI Visibility product would be missing custom tags and measures.</p>

The web application was unavailable or intermittently loading, and data ingestion & monitor evaluation were delayed. <br /><br />We will share a more detailed analysis post-recovery, but at a very high level:<br />A system update on a number of hosts controlling our compute clusters caused a subset of these hosts to lose network connectivity<br />As a result a number of the corresponding clusters entered unhealthy states and caused failures in a number of the internal services, datastores and applications hosted on these clusters.<br /><br />Our current status is:<br />We identified and mitigated the initial issue, and rebuilt our clusters<br />We also have recovered a number of our applications and services, including our web portals<br />We are now working on recovering and catching-up the rest of our data systems for metrics, traces and logs across the regions that are still affected (see region-specific status pages). The recovery work is currently constrained by the number and large scale of the systems involved.<br /><br />What to expect next:<br />We are focusing on bringing back live data for all customers and all products before catching-up on any historical data we may have stored during the outage<br />We expect live data recovery in a matter of hours (not minutes, and not days)<br />We will continue to issue regular updates as the situation unfolds<br /><br />We understand how critical Datadog is to your business, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and we are working hard to resolve this issue.</p><p><small>Mar <var> 8</var>, <var>15:12</var> EST</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We are continuing to make progress towards recovering all services.
