<p><small>Oct <var>25</var>, <var>18:40</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Hello,<br /><br />The call pipeline delay should now be remediated.  Our Engineering team has added more production servers to handle the load of API requests (specific to calls over 2 hours long).  If you are a Genesys customer you may still experience a subset of missing calls, please put in a support request if you see any discrepancy.  <br /><br />If you have any questions or concerns please file a support ticket in our Help Center.  Thanks again for your patience and partnership.  <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Observe.AI Support</p><p><small>Oct <var>22</var>, <var>17:14</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - Hello, <br /><br />We are continuing to see significant delays in our call pipeline with call ingestions being delayed up to ~12 hours for many of our customers.  Engineering will implement a temporary fix on Sunday 10/24 which will reduce the processing time from ~12 hours to ~2 hours (on top of our normal 2-hour processing time) and continue to plan for a permanent fix to get the processing time back to expected levels (2 hours).    <br /><br />Please wait up to 12 hours for your calls to be processed in Observe.AI and if you are still not seeing your calls after that time please put in a Support ticket for a one-off remediation:  https://help.observe.ai/  <br /><br />Thank you for your patience and we’re extremely sorry for the inconvenience.  <br /><br />Thanks,</p><p><small>Oct <var>22</var>, <var>16:50</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We are continuing to monitor for any further issues.</p><p><small>Oct <var>22</var>, <var>16:49</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We are continuing to monitor for any further issues.</p><p><small>Oct <var>22</var>, <var>02:47</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Hello,<br /><br />We are seeing significant delays in our call pipeline due to a limitation with processing calls over 2 hours long. Because of this, all call ingestions are delayed up to 4-5 hours for all customers. As Engineering fixes the issue overnight please expect there to be a delay in your calls processed for the next 24-48 hours. We will come up with a remediation plan for each customer and backfill calls where necessary. Thank you for your patience and we will let you know once we have resolved the issue.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Observe.AI Technical Support</p>
