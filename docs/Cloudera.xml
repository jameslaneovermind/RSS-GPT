<p><small>Aug <var> 8</var>, <var>05:01</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Completed</strong> - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.</p><p><small>Aug <var> 8</var>, <var>03:01</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>In progress</strong> - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.</p><p><small>Aug <var> 4</var>, <var>15:18</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Scheduled</strong> - Control Plane Internet ingress maintenance will involve temporary re-routing of Control Plane traffic through a replacement internet-ingress for the duration of the maintenance. Temporary routing will result in different IP addresses being used for access to the Control Plane for the duration of the maintenance window.The temporary IP addresses are within the existing IP range (3.65.246.128/27) published in the public documentation. Customers who have constructed their firewall rulesets in accordance with the documentation will be unaffected by the maintenance<br /><br />Interfaces affected :<br />Web console access https://console.eu-1.cdp.cloudera.com <br />API and `cdp` CLI calls https://api.eu-1.cdp.cloudera.com<br /><br />Customer Action/Impact :<br />Customers who have constructed their firewall rulesets in accordance with the documentation will be unaffected; no action required.<br />Any customer that has firewall policies locking the above two hostnames to the 3 current IP addresses (rather than the documented block of 32 IP addresses) will be affected for the duration of the maintenance window.  <br />These customers and their CDP environments will not be able to access the CDP Control Plane during that window.  This will likely affect automation from the CDP API/CLI and/or auto-scaling of Data Hub Clusters.<br />We recommend that firewall policies are reviewed and updated to match documented requirements.<br /><br />For more information, contact https://support.cloudera.com.</p>
