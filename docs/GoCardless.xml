<div> [Low] - Scheduled Maintenance <br><br> Summary: The company will be migrating some functionality from Amazon Web Services to Google Cloud Platform, causing a temporary unavailability of certain open banking capabilities for Account Information Services and Payment Initiation Services. No action is required, and the impact is expected to be minimal. <div>
<p><strong>THIS IS A SCHEDULED EVENT Feb <var>28</var>, <var>03:00</var> - <var>06:00</var> GMT</strong></p><p><small>Feb <var>23</var>, <var>11:02</var> GMT</small><br /><strong>Scheduled</strong> - On 28th February for 1 hour between 03:00-06:00 UTC, we will be migrating part of our functionality from Amazon Web Services to Google Cloud Platform. During this hour our open banking capabilities for Account Information Services and Payment Initiation Services will be unavailable. These power our Instant Bank Pay and Verified Mandates products.<br /><br />This migration will strengthen our infrastructure by increasing efficiency, scalability and reliability. No action is required by any merchants using these products and our analysis suggests that we facilitate very few payments during this window. We appreciate your understanding during this time.<br /><br />This activity was aimed to be completed on 20th February, however, an unforeseen issue arose. All changes were reverted and all systems were tested and operational within the maintenance window.</p>

<title>API TLS certificate authority change (No action required)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Jul <var>18</var>, <var>11:42</var> BST</small><br /><strong>Completed</strong> - The change has been rolled out successfully. The API endpoint (api.gocardless.com) is now using the new TLS certificate.</p><p><small>Jul <var>18</var>, <var>11:00</var> BST</small><br /><strong>In progress</strong> - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.</p><p><small>Jul <var> 4</var>, <var>10:32</var> BST</small><br /><strong>Scheduled</strong> - From Tuesday 18th July 2023, GoCardless will begin transitioning the api.gocardless.com endpoint to a new TLS certificate.<br /><br />This change will be transparent and therefore not result in any interruption of service, as long as your GoCardless integration does not perform any certificate "pinning". Pinning is not a supported configuration, as per: https://developer.gocardless.com/api-reference#appendix-public-certificate-policy<br /><br />The new chain of trust will begin with the following root certificate authority: 'GlobalSign nv-sa': https://valid.r1.roots.globalsign.com/ https://crt.sh/?id=88. This root CA has been distributed for 20+ years, but if you have concerns about your systems' ability to verify this chain then you must ensure that your configuration is updated.<br /><br />Email communications have also been sent out to all integrators who could be affected by this change.</p>
