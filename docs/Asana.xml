<p><small>Nov <var>29</var>, <var>02:00</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Incident: Databases containing authentication information experienced increased load and reduced throughput due to a database migration.<br /><br />Impact: On 2023-11-28 from 18:00-18:25 PST, the Asana API was operating in a degraded state and/or unavailable. Asana Mobile and API users experienced increased response times and errors during this incident.<br /><br />Moving forward: To prevent similar incidents, Asana has increased database compute provisioning and has developed monitoring around the root cause.<br /><br />Our metric considers a weighted average of uptime experienced by users at each data center. The number of minutes of downtime shown reflects this weighted average.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Mar <var>15</var>, <var>15:00</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Incident: From 2023-03-15 14:38 UTC to 2023-03-15 15:18 UTC there was a webhook outage for about 40 minutes in the US region. A bad deployment caused reduced capacity and delays in scheduling some asynchronous work, including webhook delivery.<br /><br />Impact: Webhook users experienced a considerable amount of delay, max  ~one hour difference between events generated and events delivered. There was no data loss due to this delay and backlog was recovered in ~20 minutes<br /><br />Moving forward: We have added better tooling that would help us investigate this issue faster and have increased the priority of the job responsible for streaming webhook events.</p>
