We will provide updates as necessary.</p><p><small>Oct <var>19</var>, <var>15:35</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Scheduled</strong> - We previously communicated that additional egress public IP addresses were planned to be added in the Elastic Cloud AWS us-east-1 region. These IP addresses are now deployed and active.<br /><br />Starting on October 26th, we will begin to shift larger portions of network traffic to use these new egress public IP addresses.<br /><br />What's Changing?<br /><br />Starting on October 26th, we will begin sending network traffic from the Elastic Cloud AWS us-east-1 region towards the public internet through this full list of outbound IP addresses:<br /><br />174.129.140.127/32<br />3.223.37.231/32<br />34.237.57.214/32<br />35.168.128.28/32<br />44.210.37.226/32<br />54.161.173.12/32<br />54.173.213.121/32<br />3.218.187.232/32<br />34.205.88.186/32<br />35.171.109.44/32<br /><br />How does this impact you? <br /><br />If your organization does not restrict inbound network traffic from Elastic Cloud towards your environment, there is no impact to you and you do not need to make any changes.<br /><br />If your organization does restrict inbound network traffic and has not yet allowed the above IP addresses after our previous announcement, you will need to update any relevant IP-based rules or firewall rules in your environments to include the above IPs before October 26th. Failure to do so may result in traffic from Elastic Cloud towards your environments being blocked by your firewalls.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our support team (support@elastic.co) for guidance or assistance.</p>
