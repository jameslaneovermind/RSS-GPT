<p><small>Dec <var>18</var>, <var>09:10</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - This incident has been resolved. Insights is once again showing current data. There has been no loss of data.</p><p><small>Dec <var>17</var>, <var>16:48</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - Insights platform has now been stabilised. No data was lost during this incident. We are continuing to closely monitor and tune the system for a quick recovery. Data from the last 24hrs is being re-processed and the Insights dashboards will be up-to-date once again by the end of today.</p><p><small>Dec <var>15</var>, <var>17:03</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Our Engineering team has deployed a fix for this issue and data has begun to process into the insights tool.  We estimate that it will take approximately 36 hours for all data to become available on the Platform.  <br /><br />The data becomes live as soon as it is processed and we process it chronologically. This means that the delay in live data seen in the Insights too will diminish over this timeframe.  <br /><br />We are continuing to monitor the situation and will provide additional updates as they become available.</p><p><small>Dec <var>15</var>, <var>10:02</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - We have identified an issue where the insights reporting data is behind due to a backend technical outage.  Our Engineering team is actively working on a fix to bring data up to date.  We have confirmed that no data has been lost and all will be available once the processing catches up.  We expect this to take approx 2-3 days and will provide additional updates as we progress toward resolution.</p>

<title>Permutive API partial outage</title>

<p><small>Nov <var> 1</var>, <var>18:01</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - This incident has now been resolved and full service restored for all customers. Our Engineering team are continuing to monitor.</p><p><small>Nov <var> 1</var>, <var>15:43</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - The Permutive API is still experiencing a partial outage, as a result of a global issue with Google Cloud.<br />For all customers, we have created a workaround to allow the Permutive SDK to provide segmentation and client-side activation as normal; new events generated will be used in situ on respective user devices. While server-side integrations (TheTradeDesk, DV360, SalesForce Marketing Cloud, Adestra, SailThru) are not populating segments in partner platforms, we are collecting a backlog and expect to transfer all pending data when the Google cloud issue is resolved.<br /><br />For some customers, a high proportion of events are not being collected server-side by the API, and will therefore be unavailable for future analytics. Cross device/cross-domain users will also not have their state synced across devices/domains in these instances. We will communicate specific details to those customers affected.<br /><br />Resolution of the issue is dependent on Google's resolution of the Google Cloud outage, details of which can be found here: https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/19008#19008004.<br /><br />We will continue to monitor the situation, and provide updates via this status page.</p><p><small>Nov <var> 1</var>, <var>12:26</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - The Permutive API is currently experiencing a partial outage, as a result of a global networking issue with Google Cloud.<br /><br />For some customers, a high proportion of the events sent by the Permutive SDK will be lost, although targeting for returning users / cached segments will remain unaffected.<br />We are communicating to those customers who are impacted, and we will continue to provide updates via this status page.<br /><br />Details about the Google Cloud outage can be found here: https://status.cloud.google.com/incident/compute/19008#19008004.</p>
