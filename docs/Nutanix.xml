<p><small>Feb <var>27</var>, <var>12:34</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - The update has been applied to all affected accounts with Enterprise Profiles.  All instances should have received an update and are functioning as intended. <br /><br />If you are still experiencing an issue, please create a support ticket so our support team can assist you further.</p><p><small>Feb <var>27</var>, <var>10:45</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - The update has been rolled out to all Accounts on the Frame Commercial Platform using affected versions of Frame Enterprise Profiles. <br /><br />We will continue to monitor the situation, and any additional updates will be posted on status.nutanix.com</p><p><small>Feb <var>27</var>, <var>09:18</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We have deployed the update to all Accounts using affected versions of Frame Enterprise Profiles . All instances already on must be rebooted for the update to take effect. If you have instances running, please lower the min and buffer settings to 0 and the max set to the number of instances with a current user in a session, allow the instances to turn off, and then return their values to the original numbers. Alternatively, if you wish, you can go to the "Status" page of your Account Dashboard and manually reboot any running instances.  Any instances that are not powered on will get the update when they are powered on.<br /><br />Please note that instances could take longer to boot/power on after the update. This is normal, and subsequent attempts will return to regular times.<br /><br />We will continue to monitor the situation, and any additional updates will be posted on status.nutanix.com</p><p><small>Feb <var>27</var>, <var>08:45</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We are preparing to deploy a update for accounts affected by the certificate expiring on older versions of Enterprise Profiles.

A Publish is required after the update is complete. We are also working on releasing an update to automatically force an update of the driver to the latest version.</p><p><small>Feb <var>27</var>, <var>01:39</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - Users are unable to start new sessions to Accounts with Enterprise Profiles enabled if it is using older versions of the Enterprise Profile driver (prior to 6.8.4.8008). This is due to an expired driver certificate. Users already in session are not affected.<br /><br />The solution is to update the Frame Enterprise Profile Driver to version 6.8.4.8008 using our Frame Agent Setup Tool (https://docs.frame.nutanix.com/platform/admin/frame-agent-setup-tool/#updater-view) on the Sandbox and run a Publish on affected Accounts.</p>

<title>Keyboard Input Issue When Using Certain CTRL Hotkeys</title>

<p><small>May <var>26</var>, <var>10:12</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - This incident has been resolved.</p><p><small>May <var>26</var>, <var>09:33</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - We have identified the issue and implemented a fix. Affected users should only need to refresh their browser page or reload Frame App and then resume their Frame session to apply the fix. We will continue to monitor this issue closely while customers validate that the issue is resolved.</p><p><small>May <var>26</var>, <var>09:05</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are receiving reports that keyboard input within a Frame session stops working after a user presses Left CTRL+V or Left CTRL+ALT. After using the hotkey the Left CTRL key can become stuck (requiring the user to click Left CTRL again to unstick the key) or the application window that the user is using loses focus (requiring the user to click on the application window).<br /><br />This issue seems to be intermittent and is affecting users accessing from Windows and Linux endpoints (macOS does not seem to be affected) using either a browser or Frame App.<br /><br />We are investigating this issue and will provide updates as soon as they become available.</p>

<title>Azure AD Users May Be Unable to Authenticate to Frame or Receive New Persistent Desktop / User Volume</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><small>May <var>12</var>, <var>01:15</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - An update to a backend SAML2 library resulted in XML Namespaces being improperly stripped from Azure AD SAML2 claims. This resulted in some users being unable to authenticate as Frame was unable to properly match these claims in order to establish user identify. Users who were able to authenticate may have improperly received a new Persistent Desktop and/or User Volume (Enterprise Profile or Personal Drive) upon starting a session. This issue seems to only affect customers on our Frame Commercial Platform using Azure AD via SAML2 integration with Frame. This issue was first reported at 1:15AM PDT and was resolved by 5:15AM PDT on Thursday, May 12, 2022.</p>

<p><small>Feb <var> 3</var>, <var>17:33</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Those accounts affected by this issue have been manually addressed earlier today. Any future occurrences will be mitigated with the upcoming update, so we will close this incident.

A workaround is in development to accommodate this change and we expect to deploy this on Feb 4. We will update this incident once the workaround has been deployed and confirmed.</p><p><small>Feb <var> 3</var>, <var>09:53</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are seeing cases where VM starts are failing on Google Cloud Platform for a limited percentage of VMs. We are investigating, but at this point in time the issue appears to be limited to only some GCP regions. If you are experiencing any issues with your accounts using GCP, please stay tuned for updates here.</p>

However, any Frame users that are already in a session at the start of the maintenance window will be unaffected. Similarly, any running Clusters and associated workloads will not be affected. Also, administrative features in the console related to infrastructure orchestration will not accept changes during the window (e.g. Frame capacity settings).</p>

The root cause was related to how some of our more recently updated backend services were affected by the US daylight savings time change. Note, that users already in sessions at the start of the incident were not affected by this issue.</p><p><small>Nov <var> 7</var>, <var>01:46</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are currently seeing that access to Frame services are being impacted across multiple regions.  Symptoms include inability to start new Frame sessions, view the Status page in the Frame Dashboard, or access the Sandbox page.  Users in existing sessions are not affected. We are investigating the situation and will post updates here.</p>

<p><small>Sep <var>29</var>, <var>15:20</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - The issue which was causing intermittent performance has been mitigated.  The Nutanix Frame Platform is working as expected.</p><p><small>Sep <var>29</var>, <var>09:16</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are currently experiencing intermittent performance issues due to an outage at one of our service providers, Akamai.  This is causing some requests to take a very long time and can cause some actions to time out.  In some cases, this can make starting a session take longer than usual, which may cause the session to fail to start. In these cases, please try to start the session again.  Once in a session, everything should perform as expected. <br /><br />For more information, please refer to the Akamai Status page.  https://etp.status.akamai.com/</p>
