<p><small>Jul <var>28</var>, <var>11:00</var> EDT</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - On Thursday, July 28, 2022, internal testing indicated that approximately ten percent (10%) of service calls in a portion of our customer accounts were failing.  Immediately following discovery, 1upHealth instituted its escalation procedures and engaged AWS for troubleshooting and root cause analysis.  After a week of concerted effort between 1upHealth and AWS, by noon on Thursday August 4, 2022, internal testing and checks have confirmed that all accounts have reverted back to pre-incident levels.  By 6pm, all accounts were steadily holding performance levels and have continued to maintain such performance levels as of today, August 8, 2022.  We will continue to monitor our systems for this issue, and shall provide any further updates to the extent necessary.</p>
