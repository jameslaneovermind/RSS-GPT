<p><small>Mar <var>15</var>, <var>10:00</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - We have experienced a small subset of calls reporting device unavailable for some agents, no calls were lost during the incident timeframe, and these affected calls were routed to another available agents. Agents that were experiencing this behavior were recommended to refresh Workspace in order to mitigate the issue. At this time, mitigation measures were applied and the system recovered to normal values.</p>
