<p><small>Mar <var>20</var>, <var>15:32</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - This incident can be considered resolved as we're not seeing any other ongoing issues with Paypal payments.</p><p><small>Mar <var>16</var>, <var>20:29</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - After successful contacts with Paypal, they have corrected the issue and we're seeing Paypal transactions within our portals working correctly once again. We'll continue monitoring the situation in the meantime.</p><p><small>Mar <var>15</var>, <var>17:37</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We're aware that since the 7th of March between 2.48AM and 4.42AM GMT, Paypal payments have been failing for our customers. This stems from the fact that since that moment, Paypal started responding to every payment request made by Virtuagym on behalf of its customers with the following error: "errorId:520009 - Account is restricted". This indicates that the cause of failure isn't of technical nature on Virtuagym's side and we're currently in contact with Paypal to unblock the situation for our clients as soon as possible.<br />We want to offer our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this is causing.</p>

<p><small>Feb <var>24</var>, <var>10:32</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - This incident has been resolved.</p><p><small>Feb <var>24</var>, <var>09:56</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results. We appreciate your patience and understanding!</p><p><small>Feb <var>24</var>, <var>09:55</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - The system is particularly vulnerable when multiple cronjobs are running at the same time. We use cronjobs to have the system schedule certain tasks, and try to avoid too many of these happening at the same time. Whilst we prevent that from happening, today the situation was aggravated by the execution of Semrushbot: a bot which is automatically clicking on every possible link on the old schedule, causing a denial of service on our platform - leading to the system being unavailable across web and apps. We are currently blocking this bots range of IP addresses as a first containment measure, and returning to normal service levels.</p><p><small>Feb <var>24</var>, <var>09:30</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are currently investigating an issue and working to resolve it as soon as possible. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience. We will provide an update within 30 minutes to keep you informed on the progress of the resolution.</p>
