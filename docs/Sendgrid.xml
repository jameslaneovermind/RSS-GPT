<p><small>Oct <var>27</var>, <var>14:08</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Our engineering team determined that unsubscribes began to intermittently fail when clicking on unsubscribe links beginning at approximately 5:10 AM PDT on October 24th, 2023. After investigating this issue further, the resulting error when links failed would include "invalid unsubscribe request" on an otherwise properly formatted unsubscribe link. Due to the nature of the issue, not all unsubscribe links during the affected period failed but instead the occurring issue intermittently affected links. On October 26th at approximately 9:30 AM PDT, the engineering team deployed code to resolve the intermittently failing unsubscribe links. Valid unsubscribe links previously failing have since been reported as resolving properly. This issue did not affect mail send. Systems are now operating normally at this time. Thank you for your patience while this issue was being resolved.</p><p><small>Oct <var>27</var>, <var>03:48</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - Engineers are still monitoring the issue with the Unsubscribe Links, no new reports have been received and some of these have been reported as fixed.
