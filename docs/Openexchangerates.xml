For example, if your integration references the kuna (HRK) being the currency of Croatia, this would need to be updated to the Euro with effect from 1st January 2023.<br /><br />You can read more about this change below:<br /><br />- https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_7907<br />- https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/changeover/croatia/html/index.en.html<br />- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_kuna<br /><br />If you have any questions or need any assistance regarding this change, please reach out to us at support@openexchangerates.org.</p>

The VEF currency symbol was deprecated and replaced by the newer Bolívar Soberano (VES) rate in August 2018, and this rate should be used instead.

We are continuing to monitor the results and working to prevent any re-occurence and identify downstream issues that were caused. <br /><br />Please note that as a result of this incident, the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) symbol has been temporarily removed from our latest API results. All other rates should now be available as usual.<br /><br />Clients that found their integrations made a much larger volume of requests than normal (due to failed connections) should contact us at support@openexchangerates.org, regarding having their usage allowance reset.<br /><br />Please contact us if you experience any further issues connecting to our service.</p><p><small>Jan <var> 4</var>, <var>20:42</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are investigating an issue in our API that has caused certain rates to be unavailable in our service this evening.
