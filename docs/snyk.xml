<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Jan <var> 9</var>, <var>10:23</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Snyk identified that some automated tests run between the 4th of January 2024 and the 7th of January 2024 were subject to disruption. During this time, some automated tests for European and Australian tenants were impacted; the scope of impact was confirmed limited to our Open Source and Container product suites only.     <br /><br />Tests from other sources (CLI test, Manual Retest, for example) would have continued working as expected. Our Technical Authority fully resolved the matter on the 8th of January, and automated tests are now functioning normally.</p>
