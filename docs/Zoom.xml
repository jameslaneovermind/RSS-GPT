<title>Poly Trio 8.1.5 update for Trio C60 devices, provisioned by trio.zoom.us</title>
<link>https://status.zoom.us/incidents/93mnlz4k26nq</link>
<guid>https://status.zoom.us/incidents/93mnlz4k26nq</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> [Medium] - Poly Trio C60 Firmware 8.1.5 Update<br /><br /> Summary: Zoom will be posting the Poly Trio C60 firmware 8.1.5 update for devices being used as Zoom Rooms Controllers. This update will refresh the provisioning information for the controllers and update the firmware to the Zoom Rooms Android Controller 5.15.5 application. Depending on the version of Trio C60 firmware before the upgrade, the Zoom Rooms Android Controller may or may not retain its configuration and automatically pair to its configured Zoom Room. <div>
<p><strong>THIS IS A SCHEDULED EVENT Apr <var>12</var>, <var>22:00</var> - <var>23:00</var> PDT</strong></p><p><small>Mar <var>15</var>, <var>11:07</var> PDT</small><br /><strong>Scheduled</strong> - Zoom will be posting the Poly Trio C60 firmware 8.1.5 update for devices being used as Zoom Rooms Controllers and configured to use trio.zoom.us provisioning server (as described in https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&amp;sysparm_article=KB0066569). <br /><br />Trio C60s being used as Zoom Rooms Controllers configured in the manner described in the article will automatically poll the trio.zoom.us provisioning server once per day at a random time between the hours of 12:00 AM - 06:00 AM in their configured timezone. Once they contact the provisioning server, they will refresh their provisioning information and be instructed to download the update, install, and reboot. After rebooting, the Trio will be updated to its new firmware; the Poly Trio C60 8.1.5 firmware will automatically update itself to the Zoom Rooms Android Controller 5.15.5 application.<br /><br />Depending on the version of Trio C60 firmware before the upgrade, the Zoom Rooms Android Controller may or may not retain its configuration and automatically pair to its configured Zoom Room. If your Trio C60 firmware version is 8.1.1 or greater, the Zoom Rooms Android Controller application will retain configuration and pairing. If your Trio C60 firmware version is below 8.1.1, the Zoom Rooms Android Controller application will be automatically signed out and must be manually signed in again. This is a one-time event, related to the upgrade, due to a firmware-level change starting in Trio C60 firmware version 8.1.1. For that reason, you may manually upgrade Trio C60 devices running older (pre 8.1.1) firmware from the device web GUI in advance of this provisioning server update, during a planned maintenance window so that they may be manually signed in to Zoom Rooms post-upgrade.</p>
