Only if you are not already using the remaining numbers noted above, currently scheduled meetings for 02/29/2024 and onward may need to be rescheduled so that the updated toll numbers will be reflected in newly scheduled meetings. If meeting invites are not updated to reflect the additional toll numbers, participants dialing in from Malaysia will not be able to join using the decommissioned number after 2/29/2024. Any newly created meetings scheduled after you’ve updated the numbers in your portal will be automatically updated with the remaining Malaysia toll number(s) for future invites.<br /><br />To view your current and new numbers in order to make the above changes, please visit your Admin Portal. There you will be able to find all Malaysia numbers that will remain supported.</p>

Customers are requested to keep both DigiCert Global Root CA and DigiCert Global Root G2 installed on their SBCs as we work through this transition.<br /><br />If you have not done so please install DigiCert Global Root G2 root certificate on your BYOC-Premises Session Border Controller (SBC). You can download G2 certificate here: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&amp;sysparm_article=KB0061202<br /><br />During the maintenance window, a brief disconnection of calls may be experienced while the TLS connections are being reset. Once the TLS connections are reset, the devices will attempt to use Zoom’s new certificate that is signed by DigiCert Global Root G2 certificates. Customers are requested to test inbound and outbound calling using BYOC-P SBCs and generic devices to ensure that the services are functional after the certificate updates.</p>
