<div> [High] - Major Maintenance at São Paulo Data Center
Summary: Zoom will be performing a major maintenance at the South America (São Paulo) data center, which may cause brief disconnections and missed notifications for users. The maintenance will result in automatic registration to an alternative data center in Mexico and Central America. BYOC customers are advised to ensure proper SBC configuration for failover routing during the maintenance. <div>

During the maintenance window, a brief disconnection may be experienced and notifications may be missed. If you get disconnected, the system will attempt to reconnect you automatically.<br /><br />If you are a BYOC (Bring Your Own Carrier) customer, please ensure that your Session Border Controller (SBC) is configured with alternate routing to Zoom’s Mexico and Central America (Queretaro, MX) data center in addition to the South America (São Paulo). During the maintenance window, connectivity to Zoom’s South America (São Paulo) data center will be blocked which will force calls from the Session Border Controller (SBC) to failover to Zoom’s Mexico and Central America (Queretaro, MX) data center. Traffic will continue to be routed through the Zoom SP: South America (São Paulo) data center once the maintenance is completed.</p>

<p><small>Jan <var>19</var>, <var>11:00</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Completed</strong> - The scheduled maintenance has been completed.</p><p><small>Jan <var>19</var>, <var>09:01</var> PST</small><br /><strong>In progress</strong> - Scheduled maintenance is currently in progress. We will provide updates as necessary.</p><p><small>Dec <var>19</var>, <var>11:47</var> PST</small><br /><strong>Scheduled</strong> - Zoom will perform service maintenance in the following sip zones to replace BYOC/BYOP (Bring Your Own Carrier/Bring Your Own PBX) with certificates that will be signed by DigiCert Global Root G2 certificate authority:<br /><br />Asia Pacific (Tokyo)<br /><br />Zoom had previously notified about these certificate changes as outlined here, but we rolled back the certificates on our infrastructure to DigiCert Global Root CA. Zoom is currently still utilizing Digicert Global Root CA in above sip zone:<br />https://status.zoom.us/incidents/qyzlvh0j3d35<br /><br />Zoom will be transitioning to certificates signed by DigiCert Global Root G2 certificate authority on our infrastructure during this new maintenance window and this will be a permanent change. We will not be able to postpone the date any further. Customers are requested to keep both DigiCert Global Root CA and DigiCert Global Root G2 installed on their SBCs as we work through this transition.<br /><br />If you have not done so please install DigiCert Global Root G2 root certificate on your BYOC-Premises Session Border Controller (SBC). You can download G2 certificate here: https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&amp;sysparm_article=KB0061202<br /><br />During the maintenance window, a brief disconnection of calls may be experienced while the TLS connections are being reset. Once the TLS connections are reset, the devices will attempt to use Zoom’s new certificate that is signed by DigiCert Global Root G2 certificates. Customers are requested to test inbound and outbound calling using BYOC-P SBCs and generic devices to ensure that the services are functional after the certificate updates.</p>
