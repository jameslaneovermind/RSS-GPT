<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Feb <var> 8</var>, <var>14:19</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - This incident has been resolved.</p><p><small>Feb <var> 8</var>, <var>14:19</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We have mitigated the root cause and worked on preventions in our publicly available API. All systems have been instantiated into fully operational state.</p><p><small>Feb <var> 8</var>, <var>14:17</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - We are continuing to monitor for any further issues.</p><p><small>Feb <var> 8</var>, <var>12:11</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Update</strong> - As mitigation measure, we disabled our public api which was the main trigger of the query. This ensures us that all other services are running as expected.</p><p><small>Feb <var> 8</var>, <var>11:30</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - We have identified and through identification immediately applied a fix. We are observing the system now in its performance. It was a single query which has supposedly led to a sudden unexpected occupation of the database related to product variation updates. The engineering team is working on a prevention plan now.</p><p><small>Feb <var> 8</var>, <var>11:26</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We have a spike in requests and that may make the platform appear being down. This is related to just very slow responses and we are investigating.</p>

<p><small>Dec <var> 5</var>, <var>08:50</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - The rollback has been fully released. We have observed no further errors.</p><p><small>Dec <var> 5</var>, <var>08:01</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Monitoring</strong> - We have released the fix to production. Some of our microservices are still affected, but they are not affecting the platform immediately and will be release the next 1 hour.</p><p><small>Dec <var> 5</var>, <var>07:56</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - We've identified the root cause: an update to our internal ISO27001 daily patching procedure conflicted with our current database connection setup. We've thoroughly tested this in our pre-production environment and are now rolling back the driver patch on our production system. Thanks for your patience.</p><p><small>Dec <var> 5</var>, <var>07:18</var> CET</small><br /><strong>Investigating</strong> - We are currently investigating the issue. We have logs that no query against our database can be executed, because of a timezone problem.</p>
