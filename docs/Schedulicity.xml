At this time it appears isolated to accessing stored credit cards or trying to store a card. <br /><br />While they continue to investigate, your clients will not be able to book online if you have credit card requirements.  Stored credit cards will not be visible from client profiles, and using a stored credit card or trying to store a credit card from checkout will not work. These functions will all be restored once they have a fix in place. <br /><br />In the meantime, you should be able to checkout a client by entering a credit card during checkout, make sure you do not check the ''save card'' option. <br /><br />We are continuing to monitor the situation here https://status.clearent.net/incidents/558zrbxjbprg and will provide updates.</p><p><small>Nov <var>10</var>, <var>11:52</var> MST</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - Our upstream provider, Clearent, is currently experiencing an issue which is affecting checkout and/or stored cards.
