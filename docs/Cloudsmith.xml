<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><small>Sep <var> 9</var>, <var>14:23</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - As reported by AWS: "Our internal service team had contacted Proofpoint regarding unblocking the IP address, and the Proofpoint team has informed that these blocks have been lifted on Sept 8 1:28PM PST.  " Email delivery should, therefore, now be resolved. To avoid these issues in the future, the Cloudsmith team will investigate the use of permanent Dedicated IPs in the future instead.</p><p><small>Sep <var> 8</var>, <var>19:38</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Identified</strong> - We have identified an issue with email servers running Proofpoint's platform for checking sender IP reputation. Proofpoint has erroneously flagged one of the IPs we utilize for sending email, impacting delivery to those servers. Proofpoint has already raised a ticket for the issue, and we await a resolution. Meanwhile, we're exploring an alternative route to bypass the delivery issues.</p>

<title>Access Log Export Gaps + Reduced Billing Charges</title>

<p><small>Sep <var> 7</var>, <var>17:00</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - Between the 2nd of August 2023 and the 7th of September 2023, we experienced a considerable reduction in access/usage log processing due to a change by our Cloud hosting provider, resulting in missed data for both access log exports (to your object storage) for customers and reduced metrics for billing purposes (resulting in reduced charges for the month).<br /><br />The root cause was fixed, restoring processing for any logs beyond that. Still, we're currently in the process (as of the 5th of October) of orchestrating a backfill process to restore this data for customers fully. The intended completion date is mid to late October; we'll write a communication to detail progress later. A retrospective and post-mortem will be conducted at a point closer to the completion of the backfill.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us anytime.</p>

<p><small>Mar <var>15</var>, <var>12:00</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - The team has identified an issue with exporting access logs to object storage that affected some customers in the past two weeks, resulting in zero-byte (or missing) uploads. The underlying problem has been resolved, and we're currently backfilling any missing uploads. There is no data loss; additional monitoring has been added to identify if this happens again.</p>

<p><small>Feb <var>23</var>, <var>12:00</var> UTC</small><br /><strong>Resolved</strong> - On February 23rd, between 12:00 and 13:03 UTC, a portion of traffic to the service experienced slower response times and eventually started receiving timeout responses.<br /><br />This was caused by infrastructure instability in a handful of web server instances, causing slowdowns in requests being processed, which led to longer times to service requests, ultimately causing multiple web server instances to be replaced, further amplifying the problem.<br /><br />The situation was resolved by scaling our infrastructure to handle the backlog of requests and return the service to normal operation.</p>
